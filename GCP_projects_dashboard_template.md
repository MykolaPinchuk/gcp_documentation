## This is a file explaining how to build dashboards in GCP

I will try this for a template:

Model monitoring in Vertex: https://medium.com/google-cloud/monitoring-ml-models-with-vertex-ai-5865131de353

Data studio seems to be the most common free tool to use to build dash board. Its drawback is that it does not have built-in alerting system. So I will have to build alerts separately. To do this, use custom metric, pulled from log files of Cloud function for model-eval. Modify model-eval CF to print out main performance metric so that I can see that in logs.

The easiest way to do model monitoring seems to do evth within Vertex. This could work if I sacrifice webapp serving. Or maybe I will later do both, i.e., will deploy model both via Vertex AI endpoint and GAE.
In general, I am still hesitant to go Vertex AI path because it seems not that mature, it will be harder to find info online and I will lose a lot of flexibility. Plus I have some time now to learn both DS/ML and SWE. Vertex AI can abstract away SWE so much that I will not learn anything thereâ€¦
